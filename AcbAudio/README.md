# DereTore.ACB

This project is a modification based on the "CRI ACB/AWB extractor" function of [VGMToolbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmtoolbox/).
Only essential parts, that is, parts that enables CGSS audio data extraction, are implemented.

Please note that, VGMToolbox uses the MIT License, hence so does DereTore.ACB.
